# MLProduction

pip install -r requirements.txt


This will host the API.

Open a terminal and navigate to the titanicapi project folder (first level, not the second). Then run:
conda activate titanic-django

(making sure you are executing from within the new environment)

Next run

python manage.py runserver

This will run a local development server of the django app. The model's API is now ready to call!
